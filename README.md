  # Warehouse Robot Pathfinding Dashboard

An interactive visualization tool for demonstrating pathfinding algorithms in warehouse robot navigation. This dashboard allows you to explore different pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS) and see how robots navigate around obstacles in a warehouse grid environment. 

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
