  # Warehouse Robot Pathfinding Dashboard

An interactive visualization tool for demonstrating pathfinding algorithms in warehouse robot navigation. This dashboard allows you to explore different pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS) and see how robots navigate around obstacles in a warehouse grid environment. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/KkVOlCXf68V0gCZ1Nf0lHX/Warehouse-Robot-Pathfinding-Dashboard.
